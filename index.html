        <i>Data Science</i>
        Data science has been hailed as the <mark>'sexiest job of the 21st century'</mark>, and this is not just 
        a hyperbolic claim. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts the number of data scientist
        roles to grow 36% between 2021 and 2031, a clear testament to the growing significance
        of this field.
        But what exactly is data science, and why is it so pivotal in today's digital era? This
        comprehensive article will walk you through the world of data science. From the data
        science lifecycle, its applications across different industries, the skills needed to break into
        data science, and more, we’ll provide a deep look into why and how data science has risen
        to prominence as one of the most dynamic industries today.</p>

            Data science has emerged as a revolutionary field that is crucial in generating insights
            from data and transforming businesses. It's not an overstatement to say that data science
            is the backbone of modern industries. But why has it gained so much significance?
            3/24 What is Data Science? Definition, Examples, Tools & More | DataCamp
            Data volume. Firstly, the rise of digital technologies has led to an explosion of data.
            Every online transaction, social media interaction, and digital process generates data.
            However, this data is valuable only if we can extract meaningful insights from it. And
            that's precisely where data science comes in.
            Value-creation. Secondly, data science is not just about analyzing data; it's about
            interpreting and using this data to make informed business decisions, predict future
            trends, understand customer behavior, and drive operational efficiency. This ability to
            drive decision-making based on data is what makes data science so essential to
            organizations.
            Career options. Lastly, the field of data science offers lucrative career opportunities.
            With the increasing demand for professionals who can work with data, jobs in data
            science are among the highest paying in the industry. As per Glassdoor, the average
            salary for a data scientist in the United States is $137,984, making it a rewarding
            career choice.

        <ul style="background-color:floralwhite">
            <li style="font-size:20px;">Descriptive analytics. Analyzes past data to understand current state and trend
                identification. For instance, a retail store might use it to analyze last quarter's sales or
                identify best-selling products.</li>
            <br>
            <li style="font-size:20px;">Diagnostic analytics. Explores data to understand why certain events occurred,
                identifying patterns and anomalies. If a company's sales fall, it would identify whether
                poor product quality, increased competition, or other factors caused it.</li>
            <br>
            <li style="font-size:20px;">Predictive analytics. Uses statistical models to forecast future outcomes based on
                past data, used widely in finance, healthcare, and marketing. A credit card company
                may employ it to predict customer default risks</li>
            <br>
            <li style="font-size:20px;">Prescriptive analytics. Suggests actions based on results from other types of analytics
                to mitigate future problems or leverage promising trends. For example, a navigation
                app advising the fastest route based on current traffic conditions.</li>

        <br>
        <b style="font-size:25px;">Statistics and probability</b>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size:20px;background-color:lavenderblush;">These are the bedrock of data science. Statistics is used to derive meaningful insights
            from data, while probability allows us to make predictions about future events based on
            available data. Understanding distributions, statistical tests, and probability theories is
            essential for any data scientist.</p>
